# MyArray Class

## Overview
The `MyArray` class is a custom implementation of a generic, resizable array in Java. 
It provides basic operations like adding, removing, and accessing elements while dynamically 
resizing itself when needed.

## Features
- Supports generic types (`<T>`) for flexibility.
- Automatically resizes when the capacity is exceeded.
- Provides methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements.

## Limitations
- Simplified resizing strategy (doubles array size).
- Does not include advanced features like iterators or synchronization.
